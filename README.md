## Notes

Notes is my little notepad app designed to operate on a server-client basis. You connect through the client, most likely [beprosto.me/notepad](https://beprosto.github.io/notepad/) to the server you yourself specify. The server simply holds all your notes. ^^

You can also simply download and import your notes as files, but that's less fun.

### Set up and run the dev server:
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Set up and build a deployment:
```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
